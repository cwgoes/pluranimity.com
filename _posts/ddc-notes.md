areas of impact
- decision-making structure for protocol upgrades
- idealogically generative structure for feature design/selection
- (human) organisational structure & funding models
- system design for governance instead of liberalism/polycentrism

democracy is not a font of ideas

not against spirit of local democracy & collective action - but this must not be confused with voting

that which must be decentralised, in the *end*, is *power*

the tyranny of structurelessness

but liberalism with attention to the power dynamics of large user groups

logical centralisation is good for agility

liberalism specifics
where is the data
who holds the keys
who holds leverage over network effects
what are the exit costs
do matching mechanisms exist for coordinating on rule changes
are users at an unfair UI/UX disadvantage, can they understand what is happening

### The democratic conceit

That democracy is a mechanism for setting direction, and that it should
be used to change the rules on a small number of dominant public ledgers.

These are necessary tied because democracy won't scale to many ledgers,
and if there can be many ledgers it isn't necessary.

note - logical ledgers only, not shards, e.g. tied by a token

are they really? there could be a few ledgers without democracy, conceivably
(but the rate of change won't be fast enough)

Often implicit.

in *particular* - democracy as a form of ideological gestation and as a
mechanism to explore the search space of design options

'governance as a feature'

overemphasis on *process* of voting as a mechanism to generate decisions vs
creating process for discussion & deliberation

confusion of architectural decentralisation (validators/miners),
political decentralisation (who controls decisions),
and architectural (who actually does the development) decentralisation

#### Fundamental limitations of "governance"

 Governance issues:
- Conservative, does not create innovation
- Can only try one variant at once
- Attention costs are difficult to scale
Governance will be subject to capture if allowed to monopolise.
Governance does not create innovation.

Governance cannot respond quickly to bugs. The DAO was an exception, most bugs are not gradually exploitable.

#### Ledger upgrade decision theory

No a priori reason to expect that democracy will lead to good decisions.

Individuals have little personally at stake and aren't experts.

Alignment is naturally asymmetric, voting power should be as well.

Market pricing is a reason?

#### The costs of democracy

Attention, good will (eventually), time.

Delegation (liquid democracy) alleviates some of the attention costs,
but offers no protection against bribery.

Democratic disputes create tension, teams.

It does confer legitimacy

(talk about advantages: legitimate way to remove leaders without elite infighting)

#### Architectural decentralisation vs. democracy

Architectural decentralisation prevents individual entities from gaining too much power.

Democracy is not a substitute and not necessarily an improvement. Often it may make it
*easier* for individual entities to wield large amounts of influence.

(also: no good constitutionalism, restrictions on future upgrades)

Company could build a blockchain but it could be operated in a decentralised fashion.

#### Conservatism

cite Jaron Lanier

### Proximate & distal causes

#### Path-dependent memetics

Ethereum DAO fork inspired governance.

Western misattribution of democracy, not liberalism, as the cause of societal success (may be a contributing factor).

#### Decentralisation theatre

Difference between architectural decentralisation & "democracy".
Separate concerns of platform control and platform development.

makes it look decentralised to the SEC

#### Abdication of responsibility

convenient for companies which ICO'd and now want to do something else
turns out the token didn't make any sense after all

no one at fault, no legal contract
'the community' can do it!
some of this is genuine, participation is good, permissionless collaboration too,
but not usually well aligned incentive wise

#### Attention-seeking

Gives the appearance of action.

Attention is relevant to many things e.g. price.

### What are DAOs good for anyways?

#### Aligned status hierarchies

'status' has become a dirty word in common parlance, a status which it does not deserve.

what can daos actually do? create status
align the status created with the outcomes

not altogether dissimilar from the AI alignment problem

status, in a sense, is *free* and not really zero-sum, this is a huge asset, mechanism designers should use it

#### Inter-company contracting

Threshold commitment, funding public goods, like a fancy multisignature.

#### Low-cost coordination

legal contracts have really high transactions costs
small individual contributions towards funding public goods
replacements for kickstarter, patreon, etc.

#### Architectural decentralisation of data feeds

When no better oracle option is available.

#### Option to remove people from power

Like real governments. Is this really necessary though? What underlying networks have high enough exit costs?

this should be the last resort

### The polycentric alternative

Why pluralism & compatible interfaces are better.

#### Minimise the atomic decision unit

Let individuals choose.

#### Exit costs of blockchains

Can sell assets, but not port data
Work to decrease these so that changing rules doesn't have high coordination costs

#### Necessary components

IBC!

End user support in tooling, communication. Exit costs have to be *really* low.

Coordination mechanisms for switching?

### Liberalism & power dynamics in decentralised systems

liberalism - let individuals choose, minimise exit costs, think about power asymmetries of technology

protection of individual rights & individual right to choose

this is *not* intrinsic, in general, any more than the internet was

groups of people in buildings typing on computers will naturally lead to power dynamics which favour them

requires careful incentive design at multiple levels to avoid collective action traps

information asymmetry

must also build better mechanisms for collaboration (e.g. threshold commitment)

### Strategic considerations

The enemies are not people, they are bad ideas
The salient contest, the one the outcome of which historians will care about,
is not between competing sharding approaches, zero-knowledge proof systems,
blockchains, or tokens. It is not even between public blockchains and Facebook.

note that the hierarchy of Facebook - works! problem is not internal company structure
if Facebook had instead build a uesr-rights-preserving system we wouldn't have to

The salient contest is between ideas, and their reifications:

the structure of the power relations is not all too dissimilar to that of autocratic states
but in many ways we can do better because the exit costs are lower

Reducing in-group competition

Execute swaps of tokens, acquire projects.

dissociate assets from ledgers

attract talent

how to create incentives for mergers, currently no one can negotiate, this is not great
