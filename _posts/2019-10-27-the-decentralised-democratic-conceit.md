a memetic miasma of ontological confusion on the topics of governance &
democracy has descended upon the blockchain ecosystem.
in this post I will aim to offer some inoculants

trace the origins of popularity of governance
democracy for purposes for which it is not suitable

governance is being invoked as a solution to a problem which is not clear

### The democratic conceit

That democracy is a mechanism for setting direction, and that it should
be used to change the rules on a small number of dominant public ledgers.

These are necessary tied because democracy won't scale to many ledgers,
and if there can be many ledgers it isn't necessary.

#### Fundamental limitations of "governance"

 Governance issues:
- Conservative, does not create innovation
- Can only try one variant at once
- Attention costs are difficult to scale
Governance will be subject to capture if allowed to monopolize.
Governance does not create innovation.

#### Ledger upgrade decision theory

No a priori reason to expect that democracy will lead to good decisions.

Individuals have little personally at stake and aren't experts.

#### The costs of democracy

Attention, good will (eventually), time.

Delegation (liquid democracy) alleviates some of the attention costs,
but offers no protection against bribery.

### Proximate & distal causes

#### Path-dependent memetics

Ethereum DAO fork inspired governance.

#### Decentralisation theatre

Difference between architectural decentralization & "democracy".
Separate concerns of platform control and platform development.

cite Jaron Lanier

#### Abdication of responsibility

convenient for companies which ICO'd and now want to do something else
no one at fault, no legal contract
'the community' can do it!
some of this is genuine, participation is good, permissionless collaboration too,
but not usually well aligned incentive wise

#### Attention-seeking

Gives the appearance of action.

### What are DAOs good for anyways?

#### Aligned status hierarchies

'status' has become a dirty word in common parlance, a status which it does not deserve.

what can daos actually do? create status
align the status created with the outcomes

not altogether dissimilar from the AI alignment problem

#### Inter-company contracting

Threshold commitment, funding public goods, like a fancy multisignature.

#### Low-cost coordination

legal contracts have really high transactions costs
small individual contributions towards funding public goods
replacements for kickstarter, patreon, etc.

### The polycentric alternative

Why pluralism & compatible interfaces are better.

#### Minimise the atomic decision unit

Let individuals choose.

#### Exit costs of blockchains

Can sell assets, but not port data
Work to decrease these so that changing rules doesn't have high coordination costs

#### Necessary components

IBC!

End user support, communication.


### Strategic considerations

The enemies are not people, they are bad ideas
The salient contest, the one the outcome of which historians will care about,
is not between competing sharding approaches, zero-knowledge proof systems,
blockchains, or tokens. It is not even between public blockchains and Facebook.

The salient contest is between ideas, and their reifications:

the structure of the power relations is not all too dissimilar to that of autocratic states
but in many ways we can do better because the exit costs are lower

Reducing in-group competition

Execute swaps of tokens, acquire projects.

dissociate assets from ledgers

attract talent
