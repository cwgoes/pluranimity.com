Ideas for the interchain.

### Private payments

- Alter Sapling circuit to support multiple denominations (w/same anonymity set) (trusted setup required)
- Simple proof-of-stake, later delegated security
- No governance
- Tokens over IBC (fungible)

### Oracle market

- Erasure / Truthcoin / Kleros

### Subscription management / automation

- Delegate some account authority
- Users configure subscriptions, zone sends periodically (end blocker)
- Public for now

### LRDAO

- Liberal radicalism DAO
- Fix the Sybil issues with validators
- Funds public goods between a set of chains

### Decentralized Name Service

- Cheap light client proofs, high security, slow
- Metadata, structure
- Web-of-trust w/incentives?

### Attention-priced social media

- "Twitter + attention tax"
- Liking, posting, RT/ing, replying cost tokens
- Data stored in Arweave over IBC
- Could add encryption, double-opt-in followers

### Mixnet public-key infrastructure

- PKI for mixnet
- More research

### Drone space controller

- Reserve space x time w/tokens
- Consensus ensures no conflicts
- Land/air owners, rights
- Using Ava: self-coordinating
