If blockchain development were to stagnate at its present state, would we find its operational benefits commensurate with its costs? Bitcoin (the most popular and easiest-to-evaluate blockchain) presently consumes 48.2 TWh of energy per annum, at a cost of $2.4b<sup>[1][bitcoin-energy-costs]</sup>. With 87.6 million transactions annually<sup>[2][bitcoin-transactions-per-day]</sup>, this translates to a $27.4 average cost *per transaction* in energy alone (ignoring environmental externalities, upfront hardware capital costs, and ongoing costs of labor & operations). Estimating the economic surplus of the average transaction is tricky, but we can examine the next-best alternative, which for most users will be a bank wire. $27.4 already exceeds the mean US domestic wire transfer fee<sup>[3][us-wire-transfer-fees]</sup>, and is on the order of, if perhaps a bit less than, international wire transfer fees<sup>[4][international-wire-transfer-fees]</sup>. As compared to bank wires, for the majority of users who must occaisionally move in and out of fiat, Bitcoin provides less privacy and similar censorship resistance<sup>[5][chainalysis]</sup>. Perhaps utility from use in markets without such alternatives<sup>[6][venezuela],[7][chinese-capital-flight]</sup> dwarfs that from the more mundane usecase — it is difficult to measure — but the case for Bitcoin is far from clear.
