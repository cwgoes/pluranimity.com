intro

A memetic miasma of ontological confusion has descended upon the blockchain ecosystem,
centred on the topics of governance, democracy, and decentralisation.
A certain flavor of democratic governance system is being invoked as a panacea for
the hard problems of architecting secure software systems, a method of efficient ideation &
decision-making, and even a raison d'etre for blockchain systems in and of itself. The real
causes of its popularity are not, in fact, ideological, but rather pragmatic, and although not necessarily nefarious,
the confusion of purposes risks misleading well-intentioned actors.

In this post I will define the democratic conceit which I wish to dispel,
aim to offer some inoculants to the appeal of its nebulous promises,
analyse the proximate & distal causes of its popularity,
and, as a case study, enumerate the genuinely compelling but particular & restricted advantages of decentralised organisations.

I will then argue that, instead of democracy, we should seek a decentralisation of *power*
which more closely resembles certain tenets of classical liberalism: design power & information
dynamics to facilitate equality of access & opportunity,
avoid asymmetries of information, protect minority rights, and maximise ease of exit.

In order to succeed in realising this ideal, I argue, the blockchain ecosystem
must choose both the correct tactics and the correct strategy, and there may be trade-offs,
and so I will touch on the strategic implications of this line of analysis.

deletrious ways in which the conceit manifests
- fund disbursement
- systems design (power but democratic processes)
- systems design (democracy esp. voting as goal, ideation)

terminology

Like any term swept up in the immediate cultural mileau, "democracy" lacks a singular referent. I identity three distinct concepts of democracy at play in the blockchain ecosystem:

- democracy as *value system of purpose* (that people should hold power) - this is mostly something else, often in opposition to decision-making process
- democracy as *system of collective participation* (ideas can come from anywhere) - in part good but bad funding structure
- democracy as *decision-making process* - this is what I primarily refer to

where does democracy appear in dlt?

- decision-making structure for protocol changes & upgrades
- idealogical generation structure for feature design & selection
- human organisational structure & funding models
- decision-making structure for fund disbursement

the conceit

- central conceit: that democratic *decision-making processes* will lead to realisation of a democratic *value system*
- sub-conceit: that democratic decision-making processes are an effective method of idealogical gestation / exploring design space / font of ideas
- sub-conceit: that democratic decision-making processes are an effective method of fund disbursement / system development
- sub-conceit: confusion of decentralisation of power with democracy (voting), they are different things, usually at cross-purposes
- sub-conceit: that democracy itself *is* the goal (raison d'etre, "governance experiments")
- sub-conceit: confusion of operational decentralisation (validators/miners), political decentralisation (upgrade decisions), and architectural decentralisation (who does the development)
- sub-conceit: that democracy should be used to change the rules on a small # of dominant public ledgers
  - necessarily tied: won't scale to many ledgers, not enough attenion? is this really true?

why did democracy emerge in these areas, historically?

- confusion between senses
- ideological popularity (cite Hanson forager values)
- path-dependent memetics (DAO fork)
- decentralisation theatre, abdication of responsibility
  - make it sec-compliant
  - companies which ICO'd and now want to do something else
  - turns out the token didn't make sense after all
- competition for attention, appearance of action
  - zero-sum competition
  - relevant to price?

advantages of democracy

- way to agree on changes
- legitimate method that can be used to remove leaders without infighting
  - but this should be the last resort, better to reduce exit costs
- can help avoid the tyranny of structurelessness
- allows irregular state changes but makes them tricky

disadvantages of democracy

- conservative, does not create innovation, design-by-committee
  - not a "font of ideas"
  - can only try one variant at once
  - difficult to scale
  - cite jaron lanier
- subject to capture if given power
- cannot respond quickly to bugs
  - dao was an exception, most bugs are not "gradually exploitable"
- not aligned decision-making-wise
  - no a priori reason to expect good decisions
  - individuals have little personally at stake, aren't experts
- high attention costs (somewhat mitigable)
- creates interpersonal tension
- often a substitute for actually decentralising power
  - may make it easier for individual entities to wield large amounts of influence
- dispersed organisational structures cannot internalise costs as well
  - transactions costs
  - high degree of dependence on "value capture" at all layers

an aside: what about daos?

- create aligned status hierarchies
  - status a dirty word in common parlane, does not deserve
  - what can daos actually do? create status, align the status w/outcomes
  - more status is "free", just make a new DAO, this is great
- low-cost inter-company contracting & coordination
  - threshold commitment
  - fancy multisignature
  - legal contracts have high transactions costs
- architectural decentralisation of data feeds
  - when no better oracle is available
- perhaps better internalise transactions costs

an alternative guiding philosophy

- cite https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability/
- minimise atomic decision unit
  - individual rights & right to choose
- minimise exit costs
  - currently can sell assets, but not port (Dapp) data
  - work to decrease these costs
  - coordination mechanisms for switching
- think about information asymmetry
- think about group power dynamics
- must also build better mechanisms for collaboration (e.g. threshold commitment)
- protection of minority rights
- groups of people in buildings typing on computers will naturally lead to power dynamics which favour them
- requires careful incentive design at multiple levels to avoid collective action traps
- where is the data
- who holds the keys
- who holds leverage over network effects
- what are the exit costs
- do matching mechanisms exist for coordinating on rule changes
- are users at an unfair UI/UX disadvantage, do they understand what is happening
- allow centralised structures to build the systems

strategic considerations & trade-offs

- salient contest is between protocol structures
- logically centralising decision-making power enables faster movement
- dissociate assets from ledgers?
- create incentives for mergers, negotiation
- attract talent from "centralised" world

conclusion: there is no high-level, easily implementable ideology or process that will cause web 3.0 to go better than web 2.0 - it's in the details
not intrinsic any more than the internet was
groups of people in buildings typing on computers will naturally lead to power dynamics which favour them
requires careful incentive design at multiple levels to avoid collective action traps

somewhere

better negotiation method between protocols & development teams
credible neutrality, cite vitalik nakamoto post
everyone votes in a sort of assurance contract fashion
what is the central problem? human organisational coordination
cite zooko's forum post on incentive alignment
cite edgeware "governance as a feature"
cite theory of the firm
  where do blockchains reduce transactions costs? on chain stuff, not software dev
democracy, forager values, works well in small groups because info is accurate
cite separation of powers
  government: personal ambition
  validators, e.g.: rational self-interest
