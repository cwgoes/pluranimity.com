### Benevolent Totalitarianism (find a better term or cut this section...)

#### What

Benevolent totalitarianism is jurisdictionally pervasive but action (? - related to what crime is being committed, just nuclear / bio...) restricted global policing with negligible error rates.

#### Why

[Nick Bostrom argues][vulnerable-world-hypothesis] that the relative ineffectiveness of our present legal institutions in enforcing the law may be an extinction-level risk factor:

> Scientific and technological progress might change peopleâ€™s capabilities or incentives in ways
that would destabilize civilization. For example, advances in DIY biohacking tools might make it
easy for anybody with basic training in biology to kill millions; novel military technologies could
trigger arms races in which whoever strikes first has a decisive advantage; or some economically
advantageous process may be invented that produces disastrous negative global externalities
that are hard to regulate. [...] A general ability to stabilize a vulnerable world would require greatly amplified
capacities for preventive policing and global governance.

#### Comparative Advantage

why dlt?
- separate enforcement from control of rules, avoid dystopic aspects of totalitarianism, no singular humans in control / command-and-control structure
- drastically reduce transaction costs of implementation
- e.g.: can only utilize currency iff. prove compliance with rules

#### Objections

objections to desirability

- could be captured
  possible to restrict enforcement more precisely

- existential risk factors aren't that significant
  cite counterarguments: Sandberg, Gwern

- existential risk factors wouldn't be reduced
  instead just shifted to locus of control - consensus-economic thresholds insufficient

objections to feasibility

- requires lots of data to be verifiable on-chain
  will the oracles really work?
  cite: proof-of-location, numerai thing, Augur market settlements
  cellphones running avalanche

- human law is too nuanced and interpretive to be codified
  maybe, but not sure we care about the nuanced aspects here - more about preventing nuclear warfare, bioterror
