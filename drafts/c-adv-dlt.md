Comparative Advantages of Distributed Ledgers

< state of investment vs return, most popular use-cases >

Inspired in equal parts by an offhand comment on a conference call, a skeptical question from an old friend, and an desire for a momentary zoom-out from the detail-intensive operation of an (incentivized testnet), I would like to relate my view of, and rationale for, the future potential of DLT.

model of distributed ledger:
runs arbitrary state transition function
"free" oracle access to state
selective reveal
oracle access to elapsed time (PoW, VDF w/similar diff adjustment)

> radical markets
replacing? often nothing
why? lower transaction costs, wide incentive design space, higher "complexity threshold" of possible systems, lower "coordination costs" with individual actors (no need to require trust)
cite: inadequate equilibria

> more exacting coordination
replacing / complementing: meatspace legal systems
why? precision
cite: vulnerable world hypothesis

> competing legal systems
replacing 

> incentive-aligned commons
why? creator can raise for creation of platform, credibly commit not to rent-extract for operation, not to change rules etc.

> jumping nash equilibria
why? ability to atomically-chain transactions
e.g. us / russia disable nuclear devices
more mundane example - policy compromises?

> widen the space of conditional payments
competitors: lloyds of london
why? expressivity, ease of automation

conclusion

This set of analyses is certainly incomplete, and many are likely mistaken 

feedback welcome?
