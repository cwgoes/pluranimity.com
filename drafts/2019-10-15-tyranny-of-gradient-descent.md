The Tightening Tyranny of Technologically-Induced Gradient Descent

Shorter feedback loops, local maxima search.
Need ways to jump between points in optimization space, play long-term games.
Enforcement: state, religion, can it be done with a market?
Transactions costs of contracting are very high (but it is possible, so why not?)

dimension of short-term / long-term
extrema: one: animal brain pleasure ~ miscalibration / other: ethical consequentialism with perfect commitments & oracles
rough dimension, heuristics: consideration into purchase, informational asymmetry, value of atomic transaction, basic research necessary for product
examples: social media, silly SF startups, (other extrema) carbon sequestration research

classifying current technologies on this dimension
tactics for remedying
- cultural shift among technology elites, hippocratic oath of sorts, noblesse oblige, severe social penalties for defecting
- technological constructions which are closer to the other end of the dimension and can build brand value, social integration
- legal injunctions preventing data collection to render the short-term optimisations less effective (priviledging long-term comparatively, since data is less relevant)
- collective bargaining on behalf of data producers to reduce information asymmetry
be wary of state directed solutions

class of solutions - assistant on side of end user to assist with decisionmaking
deep learning could also be used for personalized medicine
doesn't require cooperation between elites, requires business model

hypothetically, if people understood causal follow-on effects, there wouldn't be a problem
but it's not reasonable to expect this understanding given the informational asymmetry & compute asymmetry
